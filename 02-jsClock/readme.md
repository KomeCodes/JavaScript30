# Day 02 - CSS and JS Clock

**Date:** 07/25/2021
**Status:** Completed

I immediately started this challenge after completing the drum kit challenge. It was fun to build this clock and easy as well.

# The Process

I watched the tutorial video and then attempted to recreate on my own. I initially had some confusion as to why the hour was divided by 12 in the tutorial video but after some reviewing and checking Stack Overflow, I was able to get a understand it, and I made some slight changes in how I wrote the code for that part. 

## About the adjustments I made

The only adjustments I made was how I wrote the code to get 360 seconds/minutes/hours to equal 360 degrees and making it responsive by adding a media query to the CSS.

**Might add** 

I can't think of anything else to add. What more can be added to a clock? Hmmm! Maybe I'll make the actually time available in writing on the screen and also auto-update just as the clock.
