# Day 03 - Update CSS Variables with Javascript

**Date:** 09/11/2021
**Status:** Completed

![CSS VARIABLES](../03-CSSVariable/cssvariable.png)

# The Process

I watched the tutorial video and then attempted to recreate on my own as usual. This was pretty easy to create. I already knew how to create and use CSS Variables but I hardly used them before now. With this project, I have now learnt how to select and update CSS Variables with Javascript.

## About the adjustments I made

The only adjustments I made was making it responsive by using a div container to wrap the elements and adding a media query to the CSS so that the font size is reduced on smaller screens.

## Might add

I won't be adding anything.
