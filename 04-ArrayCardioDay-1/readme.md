## The Process

I watched the tutorial video once and proceeded to do it on my own, as usual. I really enjoyed doing this one because now, I am less scared of these Array methods. It does save a lot of time.

## About the adjustments I made

Didn't make any adjustments unless wrote shorter code in some parts.

## Might add

I won't be adding anything. I will continue practicing these methods so that I can get even more comfortable with them.
